/**
 * The badges, and where they come from.
 *
 * They used to be one account and one picture, written into the code, which
 * meant a new badge was a new build of the mod for everybody. Now they are a
 * file in the repository -- `badges.json` -- read when the app starts and
 * again every five minutes. Adding a badge is editing that file.
 *
 * What arrives is kept on disk as well, so the badge is there on the next
 * start before the network has answered, and stays there if GitHub is not
 * reachable at all. Nothing waits on the network: the first draw uses whatever
 * is already known, and a refresh that finds something new simply applies from
 * then on.
 *
 * Pictures named by a badge are fetched the same way and cached beside the
 * file, by a name made from the path, so the same picture is never fetched
 * twice.
